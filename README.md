As part of this project, I developed a proposal for a solution to the problem of smoking that is widespread in the population (about 20%). Smoking cigarettes is an action that has been proven to be harmful to health and has severe side effects that sometimes even lead to death.  The device I propose will use the principles that exist on the market today in the nicotine patches and will improve them. Instead of the patient having to lower the nicotine level in the patches independently, the device knows how to do it automatically according to the initial nicotine level measured. I will check the initial level for a week with a home measuring device. I will use a combination of the MIP (molecularly imprinted polymers) and QCM(quartz crystal microbalance) methods to quantify the nicotine level in a simple saliva sample. Combining these two methods can greatly enhance the nicotine withdrawal process, thereby reducing cigarette smoking rates and improving morbidity in the population.
